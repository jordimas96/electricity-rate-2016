# electricity-rate-2016
[//]: # (Description)
Created in 2016 during my web programming studies, this web displays a chart representing hourly electricity prices and comparison with past days. The site queries an API for real-time results and had a caching system to prevent unnecessary queries. The web can adapt perfectly to each screen size, even beyond typical standards. The project remains untouched since I was a student.
